# WanderingOnEarth


In this 3D game, players will be able to experience restoring different parts of the earth, including different terrain, temperature, environment, in limited time. For example, players can start with planting trees to improve the air quality and soil environment, after that, animals will be able to live, humans can have a normal daily life, and so on. There is an environmental impact assessment to evaluate where players have improved their worlds to a degree suitable for living. 

 

Flagship Technology idea:  

1. Render a live simulation of nature, vivid, complicated, and beautiful 3D worlds.   

2. Asynchronous cooperation. 

3. Complex particle system. 

4. Whole PC lab inclusion to create a multi-machine game. 

5. Rendering by nanite to get high performance and reduce computing pressure.
